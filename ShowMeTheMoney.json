    "A local community college wants a new accounting system, because the old one sucks pretty badly.",
    "Projected users: 1000+ users, staff and faculty, most of them local (but some nationwide or overseas)",
    "Restriction: no web app (the president hates the web), minimal software costs",
    "Requirements: enforce the college's accounting workflow but still allow for individual departments to amend that workflow to suit their own needs; keep complete audit trail records"
